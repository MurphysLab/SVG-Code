SVG Gradient Cleaner
====================

The file here is my initial draft of semi-working code for eliminating duplicate (degenerate) gradients in SVG files (particularly those made with Inkscape). Currently some problems do exist, as it doesn't note the existence of gradients used with stroke elements. There also is some issue with radial gradients. 

Some future items that I plan to improve:

- gradients on stroke elements
- radial gradients
